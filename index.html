					<h2 id="modelNumber">RX-78-2 'Gundam'&copy;</h2>
					<p class="testP">The RX-78-2 Gundam&copy; (aka the Gundam&copy; or White Mobile Suit) is the titular mobile suit of Mobile Suit Gundam&copy; anime. Part of the RX-78 Gundam&copy; series, it was built in secret on Side 7. The Gundam&copy; would turn the tide of war in favor of the Earth Federation during the One Year War against the Principality of Zeon. The unit was primarily piloted by the series' main protagonist Amuro Ray.</p>

					<h2 id="modelNumber">MS-06 Zaku II</h2>
					<p class="testP">The successor to the first fielded MS, the MS-05A Zaku I Early Type, the Zaku II improved on everything the previous model offered. It was faster, more durable, had a superior Minovsky Reactor, and could be fitted with more weapons. The Zaku II was the mainstay of the Zeon military for most of the One Year War. Even after the MS-09B Dom and MS-09R Rick Dom began to replace it on the front lines, the Zaku II still remained the most numerous mobile suit in Zeon's armed forces. As such, the Zaku II formed the backbone of the U.C. 0083 rebels of Operation Stardust and some were even seen as late as U.C. 0088 in both AEUG and Neo Zeon service during the Gryps Conflict and the First Neo Zeon War. The Zaku II was also a common aggressor unit used during training for Earth Federation Forces pilots.</p>

					<h2 id="modelNumber">RX-77-2 Guncannon</h2>
					<p class="testP">The Guncannon has luna titanium alloy armor, which was later adopted by the Gundam. Unlike the Gundam, the Gunncanon is designed with an emphasis on armor thickness instead of mobility and thus does not require a shield. The Guncannon's head has a simpler appearance than the Gundam's, but more complex sensors are installed for ranged bombardment. Although heavier than the Gundam, the Guncannon can jump and fly for a very short period of time under gravity due to powerful thrusters in its backpack.</p>
